login response contains role, should be used to restrict visible tabs

no file should be required when uploading experiment

file size exists, dummy value 1000 for now

should not validate annotations, this is done server side. only forced should be visible by default
    - a drop down with add and remove for non-forced
    - remove default values for annotations

don't validate names

support for changing experiments and files with PUT in progress (501) until done

error codes: 
    - 200: all ok codes, (no 201, 204 etc.)
    - 400: wrong JSON
    - 403: wrong role
    - 404: wrong URI
    - 501: should be implemented

file conversion is in progress and API is done

partial search in progress "*...*" instead of "...*" matching of names etc.

/user: edit your own profile, e.g. mail, pwd

/admin/user: edit others (roles not done, set to "dummy" until 400 response)

processing: GET in progress, API will likely change

raw -> profile: don't send metadata, do send GR (will likely change)

bowtie should be done, only one file required

processing has "halt" (name will change) to cancel processing

support for adding, editing, removing annotations exists, semantics for allowing 
    change of values not clear but they will validate so we don't care

we should test so that we can upload several GR files (investigate validation in relation to processing)
